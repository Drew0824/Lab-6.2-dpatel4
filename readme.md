# Introduction to if statements

# Step 1

Edit the program so that it works properly for the correct legal driving age.  Test that it works properly by changing the value of the `age` variable.

Then, modify the program so that it prompts the user to enter how old they are by typing in a number from the keyboard.

*Sanple run:*

Please enter your age **16**
You are old enough to drive

# Step 2

Add an `else` block to the `if` statement that states the user is not old enough to drive , creating an `if-else` statement. The bottom of your code should look like this:

```
   cout << "You are old enough to drive\n";
  else
   cout << "You are NOT old enough to drive\n";
  }
}
```

Test your code and make sure it works properly.
